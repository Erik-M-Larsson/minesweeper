# Minesweeper
Self learning minesweeper agent.

Minesweeper or MS Röj is one of my favorit games. So I will try to build a minesweeper agent with reinforcement learning.

The agent will play the game found on this website:
https://minesweeper.one/r%C3%B6j/

Some steps:
- Automate the control of the game with Selenium. ✅
- Agent playing the game making random moves. ✅
- Convert gameboard to input to algoritm and (random) algoritm output to a move/click. ✅
- Rewardsystem for the agent. Reward for good moves and  punishment for bad moves.
- Agent learning algoritm
- Training
